To Create all the schedules etc... 

0. Run everything from an otherwise empty directory before starting to organize files
1. Get the year's schedule.  Name it 'nhlschedYRYR.csv'
  YRYR are the year(s)
  Format: 4 columns: DATE, VISITING TEAM, HOME TEAM, TIME (ET) in that order
  DATE: DAY MON ##, YYYY e.g. Wed Oct 12, 2016
  TIME: XX:XX PM/AM ET
2. Run cleanup.py - it creates 'leagueschedYRYR.csv' and individual schedules for each team
  2(a). Delete the schedule for Atlanta ('atl.csv').  It'll be turned into Vegas' next year
3. Create 'bigschedule.csv' - A single column csv with Date\Team and then the days of the NHL season underneath
  Date format: MM/DD/YYYY
4. Run allteamschedule.py - It takes bigschedule and creates 'allgames.csv'
  Allgames is a spreadsheet with teams as columns, dates as rows, and opponent with home/away in cells
5. Run deltaspacetime.py - Needs 'distances.csv'
  It creates schedules for each team with 'time since' and 'distance traveled from' previous games

Note: 4 and 5 should be interchangeable

Note: Creating the single excel conglomeration was all done by hand in google sheets.  
   Download this year's and replace the data to get new results.
