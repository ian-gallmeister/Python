TO WORK deltaspacetime.py:
	python 2.7.10
	team schedules as csvs
		Columns: HOME, AWAY, DATE, TIME
		column headings in all caps, in the above order
	distances csv
	team schedules named 'xxx.csv' where 'xxx' is the 3 letter abbreviation of team city
		--found in abbrevtoindex or distances
		
	for 'allteamschedule.py'
		remember to reset season dates on bigschedule (the template file)
		if the script says there's a str object at the end, make sure there isn't an extra line 
			when opening in notepad++
		if that doesn't work, remake bigschedule.
		-AT END CHECK 'allgames.csv' to make sure team abbreviations have populated.  If not, add them in
	
	'cleanup.py' takes a schedule copy-pasted from NHL.com
		-unmerge rows
		-move date and time down 1 rows
		-delete all non-game or non-empty rows
		-save as csv
		-delete columns E and F (only need 'Date', 'Visiting Team', 'Home Team', 'Time' in that order)
		-gives 31 files - individual team schedules and league schedule without any weird empty rows in middle
		
	IN CASE OF EXPANSION/RELOCATION:
		-remove old teams' rows (to 'distances.csv')
		-add new teams' rows (to 'distances.csv')
		-adjust teamtonumber for new entries and their indeces (in 'deltaspacetime.py')
		-remove/add former/new teams from teamtimezone and teamtoabbrev (in 'cleanup.py')
